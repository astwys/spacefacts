                p I remember the time when I was 8 years old. It was the time when I first realized how to use a computer for more than just scribbling things in Paintbrush. I learned how to use the Internet, how to search for information I wouldn't have gotten elsewhere.

                p It was also the time when I arouse interest in space, the universe and everything that belongs to that topic. I have to thank my mother for that. I can't even remember when she first bought me books about any theme that interested me and there was this one particular book that fascinated me for a much longer time than any other book. It is called "George's secret book to the Universe" by Stephen Hawking and his daughter Lucy Hawking. As far as I can remember I read this book 3 or 4 times in a row.

                p Up until last October it seemed I already had forgotten about my interest in space. I was so busy studying I couldn't even think of anything else than school. But then we got to do a task: "Build a website about any topic you want". I had to think about that for quite some time, but then it came to my mind!

                p The moment I knew the topic for my website I felt like being 8 years old again. I remembered all the things I had learned about space from Hawking's books and instantly knew the topics I'd like to have on my website.

                p The feeling I had and still have, while reading all the articles and gathering information for my website, it is like a dream come true:
